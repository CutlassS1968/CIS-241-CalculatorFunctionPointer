# CIS 241 Calculator Using Function Pointers
### Homework assignment 2 of 4 (part 1) in CIS 241


## Due Date:

  October 23, 2020
  
## Program Description:
Using the techniques you learned in Fig. 7.28, create a text-based, menu-driven program that allows the user to choose whether to add, subtract, multiply or divide two numbers. The program should then input two double values from the user, perform the appropriate calculation and display the result. Use an array of function pointers in which each pointer represents a function that returns void and receives two double parameters. The corresponding functions should each display messages indicating which calculation was performed, the values of the parameters and the result of the calculation. 

## Grading Criteria
* Correctness & Completeness 70%
* Program Output & Testing 15%
* Program Orginization & Source Code Management 10%
* Documentation 5%
